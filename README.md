# Real-Time Music Recommendation using Pyspark and Kafka

### Introduction
* Suggesting different songs or musical artists to a user is important to many music streaming services, such as Pandora and Spotify.
* Users tend to prefer platforms with good recommendations of their taste in music.
* In this project, we have created a recommender system that will recommend new musical artists to a user based on their listening history.
* In addition, this type of recommender system could also be used as a means of suggesting TV shows or movies to a user (e.g., Netflix).

### Motivation
* In 2021, recorded streaming revenue alone exceeded $16.9 billionâ€”with Spotify leading the way.
* Spotify paid music rights holders more money than ever in 2021: $7+ billion
* The world-class recommendations and availability of an enormous number of songs made music streaming platforms a go-to option.
