# Real-Time Music Recommendation using Pyspark and Kafka

### Introduction
* Suggesting different songs or musical artists to a user is important to many music streaming services, such as Pandora and Spotify.
* Users tend to prefer platforms with good recommendations of their taste in music.
* In this project, we have created a recommender system that will recommend new musical artists to a user based on their listening history.
* In addition, this type of recommender system could also be used as a means of suggesting TV shows or movies to a user (e.g., Netflix).

### Motivation
* In 2021, recorded streaming revenue alone exceeded $16.9 billionâ€”with Spotify leading the way.
* Spotify paid music rights holders more money than ever in 2021: $7+ billion
* The world-class recommendations and availability of an enormous number of songs made music streaming platforms a go-to option.

##### Kafka Streaming
* Kafka acts as a producer. 
* It streams a message as a batch or a single data item (we stream single data item per message).

#### PySpark with Kafka Integration
* Start the Kafka streamer (acting as producer) - pass the dataset path there.
` spark-submit --packages org.apache.spark:spark-sql-kafka-0-10_2.12:3.1.0 producer.py `
* Kafka topic needs to be created before passing it to PySpark API: (using the command below)
`./bin/kafka-topics.sh localhost:2181 -topic demo -create`
